# NPB→MLB Translation: Tatsuya Imai (RHP, Age 26)

**Role:** Impact #3 starter with #2 upside  
**Projection:** 112 ERA+, 3.99 FIP, 165 IP  
**Contract band:** 5 years, ~$105M (includes posting fee)  
**Grade:** A- (high-quality starting pitcher, strong value at projected cost)

---

## Objective

Translate Tatsuya Imai's 2025 NPB performance into an MLB-equivalent projection using a FIP-based model focused on what pitchers control (strikeouts, walks, home runs) and comps to recent NPB imports.

---

## Methodology

- **Comps:** Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Shota Imanaga, Kodai Senga, Kenta Maeda (10,361 MLB pitches).  
- **Translation focus:** K, BB, HR as core inputs to FIP.  
- **NPB→MLB translation factors applied:**  
  - FIP: ×1.48 (2.70 → 3.99)  
  - K/9: +0.6  
  - BB/9: +0.1  
  - HR/9: +0.5

This yields a translated FIP of 3.99, which maps to an estimated 112 ERA+ (about 12% better than league average).

## Key Results

**2025 NPB line:** 163.2 IP, 1.92 ERA, 2.70 FIP, 178 K, 45 BB, 6 HR  

**Translated MLB Year 1:**  
- 165 IP, 112 ERA+, 3.99 FIP  
- 10.4 K/9, 2.6 BB/9, 1.2 HR/9  
- Estimated 2.5–3.0 WAR, projected W–L around 12–9

**Overall outcome:** Above-average #3 starter profile with realistic #2 upside if secondary pitch development continues.

## Arsenal Summary

**Fastball (60):** 92–95 mph, touches 99; low release point creates a "rising" effect at the top of the zone and adds deception.

**Reverse slider (65 – out pitch):** 84–87 mph with arm-side movement that is unusual in MLB; 46% overall whiff rate and 53% vs RHB, diving late into right-handed bats.

**Changeup family (55):** Traditional changeup (83–86), vulcan change (82–85), and an increasingly used splitter (84–86), giving multiple looks vs left-handed hitters.

**Needs:** Curveball currently grades around 40; adding a more defined top-to-bottom breaking ball would complete a six-pitch mix and add another weapon early in counts.

## Risk, Context, and Year 1 Plan

### Key Risk Factors

- Elevated walk rate vs LHB (8.5% in 2025), partially addressed by splitter development.  
- No prior experience on a 5-day rotation schedule; requires workload management.  
- Curveball is underdeveloped relative to the rest of the arsenal.

### Year 1 Usage Plan

- **April–May:** 6-day rest, 80–90 pitches per start to build workload.  
- **June–July:** Transition to a 5-day schedule, 90–100 pitches.  
- **August–September:** Full 5-day routine, 95–105 pitches.  
- **Target:** 165 IP over 26–28 starts, modeled on Yamamoto's conservative first MLB season ramp.

---

## Verdict

Imai is a young, athletic right-hander with elite bat-missing ability, a four-year track record of improving command (from 5.1 to 2.5 BB/9), and a diverse arsenal headlined by a unique reverse slider.

**The model projects:**

- **Years 1–2:** 112–118 ERA+, 165–180 IP, ~2.5–3.0 WAR.  
- **Years 3–5:** 120–125 ERA+, 180+ IP, ~3.5–4.0 WAR at peak.

At an estimated $21M AAV and a total outlay in the $100–110M range, he profiles as strong value relative to older free-agent starters (e.g., Burnes, Fried) given his age-26 window and ceiling.
